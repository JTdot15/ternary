This is a MPI program in C++ that calculates random Collatz sequences between numbers UL and LL (upper limit and lower limit). 
The sequences calculated are uniquely random and do not repeat numbers.
Total is the number of random sequences you want to calculate the collatz sequence for.
This is the column key for the output files it generates.
//1 = steps
//2 = even steps
//3 = odd steps
//4 = max steps
//5 - 13 = even mod9s
//14 - 22 = odd mod9s
//23 - 31 = normal mod9s
//32 - 40 = max mod9s
//41 = length

THIS CODE IS OLD AND INEFFICIENT.
